# Leetcode
I've worked on many LeetCode problems, which helped me get better at solving puzzles. I've dealt with different kinds of problems, like working with linked lists, stacks  and etc. Each time I solve a problem, it shows how I can think logically and write code well. It's like getting better at a game â€“ every challenge makes me stronger and smarter.
